<h1>Welcome to Nerd Squad Stats!</h1>
<h4>We give you grades A, B, C, or D and comments based on your performance. We also state your subject to keep track of everything. As you can see, you also get a color. Gold is best, silver is excellent, green is great, blue is good, and orange is okay. If you go below orange, then you will be kicked.</h4>
